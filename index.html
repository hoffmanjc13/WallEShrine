        <h3>Sensing</h3>
        <p>WALL·E senses primarily using at least one camera, and the movie strongly implies WALL·E 'sees' using the two large round sensors positioned like eyes. Additionally, WALL·E seems to be able to sense sound (he loves "Hello Dolly"), battery level (he acts 'sleepy' when his battery is low), vibration (he swaps his treads for a smoother ride), pain (the lightning strikes 'hurt' him), pressure on his internals (the cockroach 'tickles' him), and boredom.</p>
        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>In the first act of the movie, WALL·E primarily uses his sensory data to plan optimal trash compacting and stacking operations. After he meets EVE, WALL·E mostly uses his sensory data to choose the most optimal path to EVE, and then take it. He also prioritizes collecting 'interesting' objects, including the plant, at all stages of his journey.</p>
        <h3>Action</h3>
        <p>While on Earth, WALL·E uses his treads to drive, and his arms and inbuilt trash compactor to gather, compact, and stack trash. He also can collaps into a cube shape when he determines he is in danger. In zero G, WALL·E uses his arms to mainpulate a fire extingusher to propel himself. He can also speak a few limited phrases ("WALL·E," "Eva," and part of the word "Directive") and play back cassette tapes.</p>
